<h1>Zaso Items</h1>

ZasoGD (Giacinto Garcea) has been a very active developer since the early days of IITC.
Many of today's plugins are based on his code. Some are public, some are faction only.
<br />
Beside those plugins that made their way into the "official" set of plugins that come with IITC,
he created quite a number of awesome addons. In Mid 2019 he decided to step back from development.
He agreed that I may continue to maintain his work and keep it working. Let's hope he will return
one day. Until then I will try my best and also contribute his work to IITC as it ever was his
plan. (Johtaja)

<h2>Minify Some Portal Details</h2>
Minify
some Portal Details in sidebar: mod slots and resonators info. Click on
resonators or mod to toggle. Support localstorage.
<hr>
<h2>Fake Msg Location</h2>
The
COMM chat is not secure, but sometimes you are forced to write in it. If you
want to reduce the risk that your messages are read by others you move the map
in a desolate place (desert, ocean, north/south pole).
<br />·
Move the map and
save the location. Enable the fake location. Now when you send a message its
location will be the fake location.
<br />·
localstorage
support (fake coordinates and plugin status);
<br />·
Chat input
background is red when the plugin is enabled;
<br />This
plugin overrides an IITC function. If another plugin does the same thing, the
"Fake Msg Loc" plugin may not works correctly. Put the plugin at
bottom in your tampermonkey/grasemonkey plugin list.
<hr>
<h2>Link Prolongation</h2>
From
P1 to P2 draw a prolongation from both sides.
<br />·
Draw prolongation;
<br />·
Bookmarks
support;
<hr>
<h2>ToDo List</h2>
Create
a to do list. You can specify agent name, action to do and portal for each
task.
<br />·
Sorting by
drag & drop;
<br />·
Localstorage
Support;
<br />·
Multi Projects
Support;
<br />·
Export tasks
list as text (example for gKeep) and export as TSV (for gDrive).
<br />·
Export keys
needed list as text and export as TSV (for gDrive);
<br />·
and others...
<hr>
<h2>Bring Portals To Front</h2>
Have
you ever had a portal that was not clickable? This is because sometimes drawn
elements or fields cover the portals not allowing the click on them.
<br />This
plugin prevents coverage of the portals, always bringing them back to the top.
<hr>
<h2>Emoji Chat</h2>
·
View emoji in
COMM messages;
<br />·
Emoji Keyboard
in COMM;
<br />NB:
It is not possible to correctly display all emojis from an input field (input
[text], textarea, select).
<hr>
<h2>Logs Diary</h2>
Keep
your favorite logs.
<br />NB:
This plugin does not allow the massive saving of logs. Every log that you want
to save will have to be clicked.
<hr>
<h2>Pocket Portal Details</h2>
When
the sidebar is closed it shows a small box in the lower right corner from which
to take a quick look at the main details of the portal.
<br />If
in a hover state it will show more information. It can also be moved to the top
center. If clicked it can be reduced or expanded.
<br />NB:
To see the charge percentage of the resonators you need to have installed the
plugin "made energy pct in portal detail".
<hr>
<h2>Hide UI</h2>
ALT
+ H and all interfaces and site controls will be hidden. Useful for making
screenshots without too many elements.
<br />NB:
There are many plugins of this genre, but they do not always fully fulfill
their duty. "Hide UI" with a few lines of code will try to do its
best.
<br />An
invisible button will soon be available to enable / disable the UI without
using the shortcut. #
<hr>
<h2>Multi Projects Extension</h2> 
<h3>Please use the plugin from IITC.APP.</h3>
It allows the creation of multiple localstorage for the plugins and can be
activated by selecting them from a special menu.
<br />The
following plugins on IITC.APP currently support MPE:
<br />·
Drawtools
<br />·
Bookmarks
<br />Additional
plugins that support MPE can be found on <a
href="https://github.com/MysticJay/ZasoItems.CE">https://github.com/MysticJay/ZasoItems.CE</a>
<br />·
ToDo-List
<br />·
Player-ranges
<br />·
Layers profile
<br />See
an example <a href="https://telegram.me/ZasoItems/19">https://telegram.me/ZasoItems/19</a>
<br />This
plugin provides only the interface and the code for its operation. In order to
integrate it into third-party plugins, a specific code must be declared in
them. (for dev: read the documentation).
<br />Documentaton:

<h2>Bkmrks Fixes for MPE (aka MPE for Bookmarks)</h2>
<h3>This plugin is obsolete as the code was added to Bookmarks-plugin</h3>
<s>This
plugin allows the use of multi projects in bookmarks.</s>
<br /><s>You
need to have installed:</s>
<br /><s>·</s><s>
</s><s>"Bookmarks
for Maps and Portals";</s>
<br /><s>·</s><s>
</s><s>"Multi
Projects Extension;"</s>

Fixes for MPE";</s>
<hr>
<h2>Free Sidebar</h2>
It
reduces the crowding of instruments inside the sidebar (for which, moreover,
many times it is necessary to open and close the sidebar only to be able to
recall an instrument).
<br />Move
the toolbox from the sidebar to a special expandable controller located below
the layers chooser.
<br />The
input field for the passcode redeem is removed from the sidebar to be placed in
the toolbox.
<hr>
<h2>Decay Calculator</h2>
Quando
un portale è selezionato aggiunge nella sidebar un appunto contentente i tempi
approssimativi di decadimento del portale (decadimento totale, portale
incompleto e link).
<br />NB:
Lo script tiene semplicemente conto del livello di carica dei risonatori, non
legge o cerca nessun log di quando il portale è stato catturato o altro.
<hr>
<h2>Layers Profiles</h2>
When
a portal is selected it adds in the sidebar a note containing the approximate
times of decay of the portal (total decay, incomplete portal and link).
<br />NB:
The script simply takes into account the level of charge of the resonators,
does not read or look for any log of when the portal was captured or otherwise.
<hr>
<h2>Destroyed Links Simulator</h2>
Simulates
portal destruction by hiding its links and fields (cross links if you use
"Cross Links" plugin) from the map.
<br />Support
export for bookmarks.
<br />Plugin
in beta version, [ndr potrebbe non sempre funzionare correttamente, sopratutto
se sono presenti altri plugin che alterano la visibilità dei layer].
<br />The
plugin not support the localStorage (coming soon), then if you close or refresh
the page you will lose all data.
<hr>
<h2>Draw Tools Plus</h2>
<h3>This plugin is obsolete as the code was added to Drawtools-plugin</h3>
<s>WARNING:Support for Multi-Project-Extension has been moved to
DrawTools in iitc-ce. Decisions on the remaining code are pending. (Do Not
use!)
<br />The
plugin overwrites some of the functions of the current "Draw Tools"
in order to make it more usable by third parties.
<br />It
also adds some features such as:
<br />·
merge of a draw
string that you want to import;
<br />·
export with
polygons as lines;
<br />·
enable / disable
the fill of polygons drawn;
<br />·
"Multi-Projects"
is supported; (see comment above)
<br />Always
evolving.</s>

insert a label (player nick);
<br />·
"Double
click" on the marker to remove it;
<br />·
On closing or
reloading the page all the tokens will be saved;
<br />·
"Multi-Projects"
is supported;
<hr>
<h2>Mouse Scroll Sleep</h2>
Adds
a controller to disable map zooming by scrolling the mouse.
<hr>
<h2>Font Awesome</h2>
Inserts
Font Awesome icons on the page.
<br />NB:
The plugin alone is useless, but can be used by third parties to speed up the
development of user interfaces, reduce the code to be inserted and facilitate
their management.
<hr>
<h2>Portal Hack Range</h2>
Add
a circle on each portal to show the space within which you can hack on the
portal.

date and time of the last action performed on the selected portal.
<br />The
last action is an action that changes the portal data. For example: deploy,
upgrade, mod install, recharge, damage inflicted on the portal, inbound or
outbound links, decay. The hack, the absorption of XM or the regeneration of
the XM under the Portal are not to be understood as the last actions.
<br />What
this plugin does can also be achieved with the IITC plugins "Debug: Raw
portal JSON data" and "Inactive portals. Hightlight unclaimed portals
with no recent activity".

<br />Do
not use the plugin to import strings export from other plugins.
<br />Do
not import strings generated through other plugins.
